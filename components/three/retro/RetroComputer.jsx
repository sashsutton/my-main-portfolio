/**
 * The hero centrepiece: monitor + keyboard.
 *
 * The machine deliberately does NOT track the cursor. Scroll is the only thing
 * that moves the view — CameraRig owns that — so the framing stays exactly
 * where the visitor last put it and reading the screen never fights a swivel
 * that follows the mouse.
 *
 * What remains is a slow idle breath: a fraction of a degree of yaw and pitch
 * on a long sine, plus a millimetre of vertical drift. It is there so a still
 * frame does not read as a static image, and it is small enough that you
 * notice its absence rather than its presence.
