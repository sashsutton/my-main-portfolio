/**
 * Scroll-driven camera choreography, shared by every scene.
 *
 * Keyframes are (scrollProgress → position, lookAt) pairs; we interpolate
 * between the two bracketing frames to get an *ideal* pose, then damp the real
 * camera toward it. The damp is what gives the move its weight — without it the
 * camera is welded to the scrollbar and feels like a slider.
 *
 * Scroll progress comes from `scrollRef`, which Lenis writes every frame. No
 * React state is involved, so this costs nothing per frame beyond the maths.
 *
 * @param keyframes  [{ at, pos: [x,y,z], look: [x,y,z] }], ascending by `at`
 * @param fit        how to keep the subject in frame on narrow viewports:
 *                   { landscape, portrait, subjectZ, baseZ }. `subjectZ` is how
 *                   far in front of the origin the thing being framed actually
 *                   sits — omit it and the fit overestimates the distance and
 *                   crops the subject's edges. Optional `nearer: [{ width, z }]`
 *                   lists anything in front of the subject that must also fit.
 * @param damping    lower = heavier, laggier camera

/**
 * How much further back than `fit.baseZ` the camera must sit so the subject
 * fits the viewport's width. Pure, so anything that needs to know the framing
 * ahead of time (the CRT's DOM overlay picks its layout from it) gets exactly
 * the numbers the rig will use.
