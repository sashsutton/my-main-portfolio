 * download, renders once to a small cube target, and gives the beige plastic
 * and the curved glass something believable to reflect.
 *
 * TODO — for a richer look, drop a 1K/2K .hdr in public/hdri/ and swap to:
 *   <Environment files="/hdri/studio-1k.hdr" resolution={256} />
 * Keep it ≤1K; at this exposure nothing higher is visible.
